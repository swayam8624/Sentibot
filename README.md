# Sentibot
 This technique, a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP), involves classifying texts into sentiments such as positive, negative, or neutral. By employing various Python libraries and models, analysts can automate this process efficiently.

## TEXTBLOB 

  --> What is TEXTBLOB?

   - TextBlob is a Python library for processing textual data. 
     It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, 
     noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.

     TEXTBLOB Documentation : https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html

  --> How does TextBlob calculate sentiment?

   - You calculate the sentiment using TextBlob or Vader. 
     Based on the polarity and subjectivity, you determine whether it is a positive text or negative or neutral. 
     For TextBlog, if the polarity is >0, it is considered positive, <0 -is considered negative and ==0 is considered neutral.

  --> Sentiment analysis may involve the following types of classification algorithms:
   :: Linear Regression.
   :: Naive Bayes.
   :: Support Vector Machines.
   :: RNN derivatives LSTM and GRU.


#### Other possible solutions could have been :
 - implementing nlp from scratch using transformers
 - using chatterbot api for a chatbot setup
 - using bag of words vertorization
 - using vader
 - using StreamLit
